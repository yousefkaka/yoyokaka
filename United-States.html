    <p class="bn">CDC’s COVID Data Tracker provides COVID-19 vaccination data in the United States. Please visit the About COVID-19 Vaccine Delivered and Administration Data to better understand the IT systems behind the COVID-19 Data Tracker. </p>

        <p class="bn">The National Census Population Estimates from the 2019 Vintage US Census Bureau Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United Statesexternal icon (including the District of Columbia [DC]) and Puerto Rico and 2018 CIA World Factbook data for US territories and freely associated states (American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and US Virgin Islands).

            To estimate the 12+, 18+ and 65+ populations for US territories, CDC assumes that the proportions of people aged 12 years and older,

            <p class="bn2">18 years and older and people aged 65 years and older in the territories are the same as in the aggregate of the 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico (85%, 78% and 17%, respectively).</p>

            
            <h1 class="hn">Federal Agency Data</h1>



            <p class="bn">CDC COVID Tracker publicly displays federal agency data individually by agency and incorporates federal agency vaccination data into national and jurisdictional progress metrics..
                <ul class="ul-n">
                    <li>Federal agency data are included as part of the national total for each metric presented. These data exclude the Department of State.</li>
                    <li>Federal agency data are presented in aggregate by agency in call-out boxes in the COVID-19 Vaccine Data Tracker. To avoid duplicate counts, the data in the agency call-out boxes should not be combined with other data.
                    </li>
                    <li>Federal agency data are also included, without agency affiliation, as part of jurisdiction, state, or territory aggregate metrics.</li>
                    <li>When a federal agency has agreed to provide the denominator representing the population served by the agency, the rate per 100,000 is calculated. When the denominator data are not available, the rate per 100,000 is not included..</li>

                <p class="bn22">The number of people fully vaccinated by the Johnson and Johnson Janssen vaccine does not equal the total number of Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen vaccine doses administered because some persons were reported to have received one or more mRNA vaccines prior to receiving the single-dose Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen vaccine. The algorithm CDC uses to determine whether a person is fully vaccinated is based on the manufacturer of the doses a person received.</p>
