<h1 class="hn">How a Public Health Approach Could Help Curb the Infodemic :</h1>
   

    <p class="bn">At least one million people have died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since January 2020. Many more will die before we find better ways to manage or eradicate this disease, although eradication seems increasingly unlikely. This is a tragedy of almost incomprehensible proportions.

        That tragedy has combined with another potentially life-threatening problem — an alarming quantity of poor-quality and often directly harmful information about the pandemic and quack cures. World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned back in February about this “infodemic.” This warning came a few weeks before the WHO declared in mid-March that COVID-19 was a pandemic, meaning a global epidemic.
        
        The infodemic, too, appears to have had real health consequences: one study, published in August 2020, estimated that alcohol poisoning killed almost 800 people from around the world who apparently believed an online rumour that drinking highly concentrated alcohol would prevent COVID-19.
        
        The word infodemic is not the first term to describe our online world that has been borrowed from health. During the pandemic, </p>
        <p class="bn2">researchers have talked about how social media companies should “flatten the curve” of misinformation. We talk about computer viruses and, in fact, that terminology emerged in the 1990s from an analogy to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as Cait McKinney and Dylan Mulvin have shown. McKinney and Mulvin argue that “HIV/AIDS discourses indelibly marked the domestication of computing, computer networks, and nested, digitized infrastructures.”
        
            Too often, platforms appropriate medical language. Twitter has talked for several years about wanting to promote “healthy conversations.” But what does healthy mean online? </p>

        <h1 class="hn">Content on social media platforms is indeed only one part of the ecosystem, which also includes questions around tax policy, surveillance, antitrust, company culture and so on.</h1>



        <p class="bn">One way to grapple with this problem is to draw inspiration from other concepts in public health. One potentially helpful concept is “One Health.” One Health has multiple definitions, but at its most basic it is “an approach to ensure the well being of people, animals and the environment through collaborative problem solving — locally, nationally, and globally” (this is the definition from the One Health Institute at the University of California, Davis). The One Health idea sounds similar to many Indigenous and other ways of knowing that see humans as inextricably linked to surrounding animals and environment — a new name for very old concepts.  

            However, very little discussion of COVID-19 beyond scholarly circles has evoked the One Health idea. This is strange in many ways because it has existed as a specific term for several decades and was crucial in much of the drive to create global influenza response systems. 
            </p>
            <p class="bn22">The concept matters because COVID-19 can only really be understood as part of a broader ecosystem of human interactions with nature that have accelerated the emergence of zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19.
            
                COVID-19 is neither unprecedented nor a one-off. Seventy-five percent of the emerging pathogens over the past few decades have been spread from animals to humans. These include epidemics such as Ebola and Zika virus disease. One Health encompasses more than just novel pathogens that are emerging from human encroachment upon new environments. Researchers have also considered how global food practices often create deadly foodborne diseases: more than 400,000 people die annually from contaminated food. The stakes of addressing public health problems through One Health are incredibly high.
                
                If we continue a long-standing trend of using health concepts and language to think about the online world, what can the One Health concept contribute to platform governance?</p>
