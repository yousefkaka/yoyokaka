<h1 class="hn">China’s COVID vaccines are going global — but questions remain.</h1>
   

    <p class="bn">The WHO has approved one of China’s COVID-19 vaccines for use worldwide and another is under review. But published trial data remain scarce.</p>





        <p class="bn">The World Health Organization (WHO) has authorized the first of China’s COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use, and another could be listed in the coming days, opening the door to wide distribution in lower-income nations through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative.

            The listing will boost global confidence in these vaccines, say scientists. China's five different vaccines have not been used widely in wealthy nations, but are already sustaining immunization campaigns in the global south.
            
            “There is big demand for the Chinese vaccines,” says Firdausi Qadri, an immunologist at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, in Dhaka.</p>
  

           
            <p class="bn2">The first vaccine to be listed is made in Beijing by Chinese state-owned firm Sinopharm. The other under review — named CoronaVac — is produced by private company Sinovac, also based in Beijing. Five COVID-19 vaccines are already authorized by the WHO, but unlike these, the Chinese ones use inactivated virus and are not widely used in Western nations.

                Sinopharm and Sinovac’s vaccines account for the bulk of shots given in China, which has so far inoculated 243 million people. More than 45 countries have already approved their use, but the WHO is among the first stringent regulatory authorities to review the data.
                
                “It is very important to have the support of the WHO,” said Rafael Araos, a physician and epidemiologist at University for Development in Santiago, before the Sinopharm vaccine was listed. A positive response will be “very good news for the vaccine developers and for the countries that are interested in getting these vaccines”..</p>

        <p class="bnnn">The Russian researchers say their data will be published "in one of the leading international peer-reviewed medical journals".

            If it's positive, it means there will almost certainly be more than one way of protecting people against the virus.
            
            Hundreds of vaccines are in development and around a dozen are in the final stages of testing - the Sputnik, Pfizer and Oxford vaccines are three of those.</p>
