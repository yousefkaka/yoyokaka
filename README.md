## About Book Website

If you want to take an idea about our website, so let read the following abstract :
Our website displays a group of books and a summary of them. 
We started with lists that enable you to navigate the site and look at its contents.

## Your guide to using our website is as follows :

* If you click on the Home menu, you will be presented with the main website page, including all of its sections.
* If you click on the About Us menu, you will immediately move to the section that talks about us and the goal we are seeking.
* If you click on the list of Our Books, you will move to the section on books that our website is talking about, and then you will find social networking sites.
* If you click on the Contact Us menu, it will take you to a new page. You can contact us about any question you want from us.

## Our website has four  sections : 

1. Home: displays main content of our website.
2. About Us: introduce our team and the services we provide. 
3. Our Books: displays our book collections. 
5. Contact Us: contains contact form for our customers to contact us any time. 




## How did we start working on this project ?

1. First we discussed the ideas and agreed on the basic points that support the idea. 
2. We prepared the initial design of our website on papers. 
3. We divided the work between us and every one worked on a section. 
4. We created a repository on Github and we pushed our project's sections. 
5. We reviewed each other's works through github and finally merged the sections to create our website.
